## Projects

* [Social Network Patterns in Adolescent Substance Use](https://github.com/madisonhess/personalportfolio/tree/main/Projects/FINAL_DACSS695N.pdf):

    This project analyzed adolescent substance use patterns using SNA to examine peer clustering, social connectedness, and gender differences.
    ERGMs and network centrality measures were applied in R to study how friendship networks relate to health-risk behaviors.

* [Add Health Data Analysis Dashboard](https://madisonhess.github.io/dacss604_dashboard/):

  This project examined how maternal attachment, peer exposure, and boredom relate to chronic juvenile offending using data from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health (Add Health).
  An interactive R Flexdashboard was built in R with predicted probability plots and correlation heatmaps to communicate findings.

* [Gender and Politicians' Exposure to Online Incivility](https://github.com/madisonhess/personalportfolio/tree/main/Projects/final_603.pdf):

  This project examines gender differences in politicians’ exposure to profanity-based online incivility on Twitter using regression analysis and exploratory diagnostics that were run in R. Using tweets directed towards politicians in the United States and Canada, the analysis highlights how isolating specific forms of online harassment can reveal patterns that differ from broader measures of incivility.

* [Spatial Analysis of Global Health Indicators](https://github.com/Comp-Soc-Science-Methods/HW1/tree/main):
  
  This project uses Python and R to explore global public health data using spatial analysis techniques. Using data from the CIA World Factbook, the analysis identifies countries with the lowest rates of alcohol        consumption, tobacco use, and adult obesity. Python was used to bin and categorize the health variables, and R (via sf and ggplot2) was used to visualize the spatial distribution of these indicators. The project      culminated in a choropleth map highlighting the "healthiest" countries based on the combined metrics.
  
* [School Selection Using AHP](https://github.com/Comp-Soc-Science-Methods/HW3_ahp):

  Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) was used to rank three schools based on six criteria: learning, friends, school life, vocational training, college prep, and music classes. Pairwise comparison matrices were created         for both criteria and alternatives using data from Google Sheets. The Python library ahpy was used to calculate weights and consistency ratios.

* [Undergraduate Thesis: Generational Differences in News Consumption Habits](https://github.com/madisonhess/personalportfolio/tree/main/Projects/thesis.pdf):
  
  This study investigated generational differences in common routes to news, attitudes towards news, and levels of knowledge surrounding current events. 138 adults belonging to Gen Z, Millennial, Gen X, and Baby        Boomer age categories completed a survey which assessed importance of specific modes of media related to news consumption, importance of specific social media platforms in relation to news consumption, and            attitudes surrounding news-seeking. A twenty-question current events trivia also examined participants’ level of knowledge about current events. It was found that routes to news, especially social media platforms,    varied significantly across age groups. Next, dependence on Instagram, Twitter, and TikTok for news increased the younger the age group. Finally, Gen Z proved to be the most news avoidant age group and the least      knowledgeable about current events.
